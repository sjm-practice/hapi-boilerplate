# hapi-boilerplate
A hapi boilerplate created from scratch, based on several popular existing boilerplates, for the purpose of learning structure and hapi fundamentals.

This boilerplate was built referencing the following other boiler plates: hapi-ninja (by poetic-ninja), aqua (by jedireza), nodejs-account-boilerplate (by fs-opensource), and mullet (by lynnaloo).

Folder structure, practices & style, and functionality were borrowed from each.

Instead of forking and copying much of the source, this project was assembled from scratch to gain understanding of each piece individually, as well as what components are fundamental to common robust web servers.

## Goals
At the onset, some goals in mind were to gain experience with the following components:
* Hapi
* Authentication (and bcrypt)
* MongoDB
* React
* Locale
